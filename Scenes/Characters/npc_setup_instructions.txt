# NPC Scene Setup Instructions

Since we can't directly create .tscn files through this interface, follow these steps to create the NPC scene in the Godot editor:

## 1. Create the Base Scene

1. Open Godot Editor
2. Create a new scene with a CharacterBody3D as the root node
3. Name the root node "NPC"
4. Attach the "NPC.gd" script to this node (Scripts/Characters/NPC.gd)

## 2. Add Collision Shape

1. Add a CollisionShape3D node as a child of the NPC node
2. Add a CapsuleShape3D to the CollisionShape3D
3. Set the CapsuleShape3D height to 1.8 and radius to 0.4
4. Position the CollisionShape3D at (0, 0.9, 0) to center it on the character

## 3. Add Character Mesh

1. Add a Node3D as a child of the NPC node and name it "Mesh"
2. Import the same character model used for the player:
   - Add a MeshInstance3D node as a child of the Mesh node
   - Instance the Object_Character.glb model (from Assets/Models/Characters/)

## 4. Set Up Animation

1. Add an AnimationTree node as a child of the NPC node
2. Configure the AnimationTree with the same structure as the player's AnimationTree:
   - Add a StateMachine with "ground_air_transition" parameter
   - Add a Blend2 node with "iwr_blend" parameter (for Idle-Walk-Run blending)
   - Connect animations: 01_Idle.res, 02_Run.res, 03_Walk.res, 04_Air.res
   - Set up transitions between states

## 5. Add Interaction Functionality (Optional)

You can choose one of the following interaction options:

### Option A: Basic Interaction

1. Add a Node as a child of the NPC node and name it "Interaction"
2. Attach the "NPCInteraction.gd" script to this node (Scripts/Characters/NPCInteraction.gd)
3. Configure the interaction parameters in the Inspector:
   - interaction_radius: How close the player needs to be to trigger interaction (default: 3.0)
   - look_at_player: Whether the NPC should turn to face the player when nearby (default: true)
   - follow_player: Whether the NPC should follow the player when nearby (default: false)
   - follow_distance: How close the NPC tries to get when following (default: 2.0)

### Option B: Dialog Interaction

1. First, set up the Dialog UI following the instructions in "Scenes/UI/dialog_ui_setup_instructions.txt"
2. Add a Node as a child of the NPC node and name it "DialogInteraction"
3. Attach the "NPCDialogInteraction.gd" script to this node (Scripts/Characters/NPCDialogInteraction.gd)
4. Configure the interaction parameters as in Option A
5. Configure the dialog parameters in the Inspector:
   - npc_name: The name of the NPC to display in the dialog
   - dialog_lines: An array of strings containing the NPC's dialog lines
   - dialog_ui_path: The path to the DialogUI node in your scene

For both options, add the player to a group for the interaction script to find it:
- Open the player scene
- Select the root node
- In the Inspector, go to Node > Groups and add "player" (lowercase)
- For compatibility, you can also add "Player" (uppercase) as an additional group

## 6. Save the Scene

1. Save the scene as "npc.tscn" in the Scenes/Characters/ directory

## 7. Instance in Level

To add the NPC to your level:
1. Open your level scene (e.g., prototype.tscn)
2. Instance the npc.tscn scene
3. Position the NPC where you want it in the level
4. The NPC will automatically start wandering around its initial position

## Notes on NPC Behavior

- The NPC will wander randomly within the radius specified in the script (default: 5.0 units)
- Wander timing is randomized between min and max values (default: 3-8 seconds)
- The NPC uses the same animation states as the player but only uses idle and walk animations
- You can adjust movement parameters in the Inspector after selecting the NPC node
