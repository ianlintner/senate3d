# Dialog UI Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to create a simple dialog UI that can be used with NPCs:

## 1. Create the Dialog UI Scene

1. Open Godot Editor
2. Create a new scene with a Control node as the root
3. Name the root node "DialogUI"
4. Add the node to the "dialog_ui" group (this is important for automatic detection):
   - Select the DialogUI node
   - In the Inspector, go to Node > Groups and add "dialog_ui"
   - Make sure the group name is all lowercase
5. Attach the "NPCDialog.gd" script to this node (Scripts/UI/NPCDialog.gd)

## 2. Create the Dialog Box

1. Add a Panel (or NinePatchRect) as a child of DialogUI and name it "DialogBox"
2. Position it at the bottom of the screen (e.g., anchor to bottom-center)
3. Set its size to cover about 1/4 of the screen height and most of the width
4. Style it as desired (background color, border, etc.)

## 3. Add Text Elements

1. Add a Label as a child of DialogBox and name it "NameLabel"
   - Position it at the top-left of the DialogBox
   - Set its size and font properties as desired
   - This will display the NPC's name

2. Add a Label as a child of DialogBox and name it "DialogText"
   - Position it below the NameLabel and make it fill most of the DialogBox
   - Set its size and font properties as desired
   - Enable autowrap for the text
   - This will display the dialog text

3. Optionally, add a Label or TextureRect at the bottom-right with text like "[Space]" or a continue icon
   - This indicates to the player how to advance the dialog

## 4. Configure the Dialog Script

1. Select the DialogUI node
2. In the Inspector, set the exported variables:
   - dialog_box_path: NodePath to the DialogBox node
   - dialog_text_path: NodePath to the DialogText node
   - dialog_name_path: NodePath to the NameLabel node

## 5. Save the Scene

1. Save the scene as "dialog_ui.tscn" in the Scenes/UI/ directory

## 6. Add to Main Scene

To use the dialog UI:

1. Instance the dialog_ui.tscn scene in your main level scene
2. Make sure it's added to the CanvasLayer to ensure it appears on top of the 3D world
3. Set its initial visibility to false (it will be shown when dialog starts)

## 7. Connect to NPCs

To connect NPCs to the dialog system:

1. When setting up an NPC with dialog capability:
   - Add the NPCDialogInteraction.gd script instead of (or in addition to) NPCInteraction.gd
   - Set the dialog_ui_path to point to your DialogUI node
   - Configure the npc_name and dialog_lines in the Inspector

## Notes on Dialog System

- The dialog system uses the "ui_accept" input action (usually Space or Enter) to advance dialog
- Dialog will automatically start when the player enters the NPC's interaction radius
- After dialog finishes, there's a 2-second cooldown before the NPC can start dialog again
- You can extend this system by adding animations, sound effects, or more complex dialog trees
